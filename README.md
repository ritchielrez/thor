# Thor

**An Odin inspired programming language with personal touches**

Thor is an experimental programming language written in C that draws inspiration from [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/). The goal of this project is to explore programming language design and implementation, build new language features, and add personal touches that reflect my preferences as a developer.

## Why Thor?

As programming enthusiasts, we often admire features and philosophies in existing languages. Odin stands out for its simplicity, performance, and clean syntax for systems programming. Thor aims to learn from Odin, but also experiment with new ideas and customizations, making the journey both a learning experience and a potential playground for fresh concepts.

## Project Goals

- **Learn-by-doing:** Deepen understanding of compiler construction and programming language theory.
- **Experimentation:** Test new language features, syntactic sugar, or tooling ideas.
- **Personalization:** Add features and adjustments inspired by my use cases or preferences.
- **Community Feedback:** Invite contributions and ideas from other language enthusiasts.

## Current Status

- Written entirely in C.
- Early development: exploring core syntax, semantics, and structure.
- Planning and proof-of-concept phases for parsing, type checking, and code generation.

## Getting Started

> ⚠️ **Note:** Thor is in its early stages and is not ready for production use. Expect incomplete features and rapid changes!

### Requirements

- C/C++ Compiler (GCC/Clang/Microsoft Visual C++)

### Build Instructions

To build from source,

in Linux/Mac OSX:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ritchielrez/thor.git
cd thor
gcc build.c -o build
./build com
```

in Windows:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/ritchielrez/thor.git
cd thor
cl build.c
build.exe com
```

## Usage

Thor does not yet have a stable syntax or standard library. Expect frequent breaking changes as language features are added and refined.

## Inspiration

- [Odin Programming Language](https://odin-lang.org/)
- [C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))

## Contributing

Curious minds and contributors are very welcome! If you have thoughts, suggestions, or just want to chat about language design, please open an issue or start a discussion.
